# Faucet for Distributing Test Tokens

## Project Title
Faucet for Distributing Test Tokens

## Project Description
This project is a smart contract-based faucet designed to distribute test tokens to users in a controlled and fair manner. The faucet enables users to claim a predefined amount of tokens at fixed intervals, ensuring an equitable distribution of test tokens for development and testing purposes.

## Project Vision
The vision of this project is to provide a reliable and automated solution for distributing test tokens to users and developers. By utilizing a smart contract, the faucet eliminates manual distribution and ensures transparency and security in token allocation.

## Future Scope
- Support for multiple test tokens.
- User authentication to prevent abuse.
- Adjustable claim limits based on user activity.
- Integration with blockchain testnets for wider accessibility.
- UI/UX development for seamless interaction with the faucet.

## Key Features
- *Automated Token Distribution:* Users can claim tokens at regular intervals.
- *Cooldown Mechanism:* Prevents excessive claims by enforcing a cooldown period.
- *Fundable Faucet:* The contract owner can replenish the faucet with additional tokens.
- *Transparent & Secure:* Transactions are recorded on-chain, ensuring trustworthiness.
- *Easy Integration:* Developers can use the faucet to obtain test tokens for smart contract testing.
